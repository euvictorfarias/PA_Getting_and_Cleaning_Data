Author: Victor Farias
Project submitted to the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" offered
by Coursera and Johns Hopkins as final project.
=================================================================
The main objective of this project is to merge two datasets and organize into a second dataset. Then a third dataset is created to add one column that contain the activities informations. The fourth dataset renames the third dataset variables, or columns. The next one dataset create another column called "Subjects" the contain informations about the 30 subjects. The last one create a tidy dataset with averages according to the activity and the subject variables.
To realize all of this actions, a main script called "run_analysis.R" was created. This script calls six different functions, one responsable to do one step of the project and one function extra. The comments in all the scripts explain better, step by step, all the code.
Lastly, the data used in this project can be find attached.
=================================================================
The project includes the following files:
- READ_ME: This text file;
- Dataset: A file containing all the data used in this project;
- run_analysis.R: The main script, it calls all the other functions;
- returnMerge.R: The function of the Step 1;
- meanAndStd.R: The function of the Step 2;
- getActivity.R: The function of the Step 3;
- labelVariables.R: The function of the Step 4;
- getSubject.R: The function of the Step between 4 and 5;
- lastStep.R: The function of the Step 5;
